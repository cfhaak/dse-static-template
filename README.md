## What is this?
* This is a slightly simplified test template of [DSE-Static-Cookiecutter](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter).
* This isn’t intended for production use! Rather use [DSE-Static-Cookiecutter](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter) for this purpose.
* This is a template repository, if you don’t know what this means, feel free to [read this](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) or just click ```Use this template``` (top right corner) and then ```Create a new repository```. It probably does what you expect. However, you’ll need a github account to access these functionalities. (Whatever System you are using you will need a github account. You’ll need one anyways, if you want to try this tutorial.)

## Setup
Follow the steps provided in the [documentation for the local setup](./run_it.md).
