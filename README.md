## What is this?
* This is a slightly simplified test template of [DSE-Static-Cookiecutter](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter).
* This isn't intended for production use! Rather use [DSE-Static-Cookiecutter](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter) for this purpose.
* This is a template repository, if you don't know what this means, feel free to [read this](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) or just click ```Use this template``` (top left corner). It probably does what you expect.
